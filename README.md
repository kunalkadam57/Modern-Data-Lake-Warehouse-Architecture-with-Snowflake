# Modern-Data-Lake-Warehouse-Architecture-with-Snowflake
Designed and implemented a modular Snowflake-based pipeline simulating real-world ingestion from external sources (e.g., APIs, raw files). Created external tables on Parquet files via Snowflake Stages, applied schema evolution via Iceberg, and transformed raw data using SQL and JSON parsing.
